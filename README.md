# B3 Map Likes Plugin
**By clearskies**

Allows players to !like or !dislike the current map. After they inital vote, they can change their minds three times. The !mlikes command will display the like and dislikes that the current map has.

### Setup
You must run the maplikes.sql file against your B3 database, or else the plugin will die horribly.
